### Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.5.6
- Spring WebSocket
- Maven
- In-memory storage (ConcurrentHashMap)

**Frontend:**
- React 19.2.0
- React Router 7.9.4
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.18
- Lucide Icons
- Native WebSocket API

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Server-Authoritative Design**
   - All game state managed on server
   - Client only renders and sends requests
   - Prevents cheating and ensures fair play

2. **WebSocket Communication**
   - Real-time bidirectional communication
   - Instant board updates for both players
   - Automatic reconnection on connection loss

3. **In-Memory Storage**
   - Fast read/write operations
   - Thread-safe with ConcurrentHashMap
   - Suitable for prototype/demo
   - Can be replaced with Redis/Database for production

4. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Reusable React components
   - Separation of concerns
   - Easy to test and maintain

5. **Matchmaking Queue**
   - First-come-first-serve pairing
   - Automatic game creation
   - Thread-safe queue implementation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.6+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

#### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Server starts at: `http://localhost:8080`

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
App starts at: `http://localhost:3000`

### Testing
Open two browser windows:
1. Register Player 1 → Find Match
2. Register Player 2 → Find Match
3. Game starts! Players alternate turns

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Player Management
- `POST /api/players/register` - Register new player
- `GET /api/players/{id}` - Get player details

### Game Management
- `POST /api/games/matchmaking` - Find or create match
- `POST /api/games/{gameId}/move` - Make a move
- `GET /api/games/{gameId}` - Get game state

### Leaderboard
- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Get top 10 players

### WebSocket
- `ws://localhost:8080/game/{gameId}` - Game state updates

## 🎮 Game Flow
Player Registration → Menu Screen → Matchmaking Queue
↓
Match Found
↓
Game Starts (IN_PROGRESS)
↓
Player X moves → Player O moves → ...
↓
Win / Draw (FINISHED)
↓
Leaderboard Updated
## 🏆 Scoring System

- **Win:** +3 points, +1 win
- **Draw:** +1 point, +1 draw
- **Loss:** 0 points, +1 loss

Leaderboard ranks by: `(wins × 3) + draws`

## 🔒 Security Features

- Server-side move validation
- Turn order enforcement
- Cell occupancy checks
- Rate limiting ready (commented in code)
- CORS configured for production

## 🚢 Deployment

### Backend (Railway)
```bash
git push origin main
# Railway auto-deploys from GitHub
```

### Frontend (Vercel)
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables

Frontend .env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api
REACT_APP_WS_URL=wss://your-backend.railway.app/game

## 📱 Mobile Optimization
